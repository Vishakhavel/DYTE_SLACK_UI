The redesign for “slack” was not inspired from any existing application store, but rather it is an extension of what a website should look like from the point of view of a user.
Extensive research was done on websites like https://utilityapi.com/ and https://rapidapi.com/resources/, since they target the same user base. So the redesign was done keeping in mind that the users were developers and persons already using the products of Slack ©.


## _The main page after enabling the dark theme looks like this:_

 ## _The sign up page in my design looks like this:_

## THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE EXISTING WEBSITE DESIGN:
1. The website does not offer any provision to switch themes, for those who prefer a darker theme for the websites they visit.
2. The main screen of the website is flooded with content, hence making it impossible for the user to make a quick purchase. Only the main content, which brings more profit to Slack © should be presented in the “featured” section and the rest should be put under categories in a sidebar menu.
3. A very stale login page, that lacks visuals and excitement
4. The lack of a theme color for the website, making it too plain.



## HOW I SOLVED THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS.
1. I added a clean sign-in the page, that was interactive by setting hover states for elements I found relevant.
2. I added the theme of purple for the entire website, making it less dreary and plain.
3. I added visualizations to parts of the website that I found were too plain. This made the
website more engaging.
4. A toggle switch was created to switch between dark and light themes. This gave the
users an option and made the website more lively.

5. I added a “FEATURED” section and put in the mostly sought after apps and services.
6. I put all other services in a side NavBar, which expanded when the main heading was
clicked. This would make the website more presentable and the tools more accessible.

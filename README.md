# DYTE_SLACK_UI

The redesign for “slack” was not inspired from any existing application store, but rather it is an extension of what a website should look like from the point of view of a user.
Extensive research was done on websites like https://utilityapi.com/ and https://rapidapi.com/resources/, since they target the same user base. So the redesign was done keeping in mind that the users were developers and persons already using the products of Slack ©.




THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE EXISTING WEBSITE DESIGN:
1. The website does not offer any provision to switch themes, for those who prefer a darker theme for the websites they visit.
2. The main screen of the website is flooded with content, hence making it impossible for the user to make a quick purchase. Only the main content, which brings more profit to Slack © should be presented in the “featured” section and the rest should be put under categories in a sidebar menu.
3. A very stale login page, that lacks visuals and excitement
4. The lack of a theme color for the website, making it too plain.


The main page after enabling the dark theme looks like this:
